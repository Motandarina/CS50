# Questions

## What's `stdint.h`?
<stdint.h> is a header file declaring various integer types with certain guaranteed widths. 

## What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?

 Using these types allows to write implementation- and plattform-independent code.

## How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?

`BYTE`:1 bytes
`DWORD`:4 bytes
`LONG`:4 bytes
`WORD`:2 bytes

## What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

TODO

## What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?

TODO

## What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?

TODO

## What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

TODO

## Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in lines 24 and 32 of `copy.c`?

TODO

## Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code? (For example, see lines 40, 44, and 75.)

TODO

## What value does line 63 of `copy.c` assign to `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?

TODO

## What does `fseek` do?

## What is `SEEK_CUR`?
